While a client is joined to a channel, they receive all relevant information about that channel including the JOIN, PART, KICK, and MODE messages affecting the channel. They receive all PRIVMSG and NOTICE messages sent to the channel, and they also receive QUIT messages from other clients joined to the same channel (to let them know those users have left the channel and the network). This allows them to keep track of other channel members and channel modes.
